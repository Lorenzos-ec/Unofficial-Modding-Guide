Due to the hard work of them we are currently able to get around 80-90% of the experience that Official Maps have; there is expected to be a little bit of Jank when creating maps.This guide will step you through the basic set of requirements needed to build custom levels for Ready or Not and complete your first iteration by getting your map into the game. Ready or Not mapping REQUIRES that you download and use Unreal Engine 4.27.2. Do not download or use any other version. If this is your first time creating a map, be aware that the level of experience to create something functioning is considered Intemediate. It is recommended that you spend some time watching and learning some beginner videos for UE4 on youtube before you start asking too many newbie questions.If you need help or have any questions, don’t hesitate to join the RoN Custom Maps Discord!The Level Design Cycle for RoNWe currently provide a template project that contains all the gameplay features/blueprints needed to make RoN maps here: Installation.For the Level Design process, you pretty much do it all within Unreal Engine, and can use whatever (reasonable) method you want to create your level.It is important to note that currently we cannot test gameplay within Unreal Engine and can only do it within the Game. To actually play the level you need to pack your level into a deployable .PAK file. More info here: Cooking &amp; Packaging &amp; InstallingDevelopment ExampleIf you would like to see what it’s like to make a map for Ready or Not, I recorded my entire development for Hell Comes to the Hills.YouTube Playlist: Ready or Not: Custom Map Development by DeltaInstallationUnreal Engine Download and install the Epic Launcher. Open the Launcher, go Unreal Engine on the left side bar, then Library along the top toolbar Under Engine Versions press the + icon and next to the Version Number, click the drop down and select 4.27.2 and InstallThe Template Project Currently we have a pre-release project that you NEED to use for maps to work for 1.0. Do not use the Covered Bones Template available on Nexus. THIS IS LIKELY TO CHANGE A LOT, TO KEEP UP TO DATE, PLEASE JOIN THE DISCORD. Create a Folder anywhere and name it whatever you want. This will be the folder you need to extract the following files into. I will refer to this folder as RoNTemplate.

This will launch the Project and may take a couple of minutes to load if this is your first time using Unreal. Just be patient. HELP! I Get 100s of errors when I load up the project!This is normal, it’s just missing some game files that you can extract later on. We also don’t have access to everything. Any errors you get on start-up are fine and will not give you any issues, provided you followed the steps so far exactly.The Folder StructureBefore we continue, it is very important to understand the folder structure of an Unreal Project.Unreal uses this concept of a Content folder, this is where all the game content and maps for the game reside (located at: ...\\RoNTemplate\\Content).When you install a .PAK file you are essentially adding or overriding assets in Content. Any change you make here will likely affect other mods that people use. This a more common occurance when a lot of us are using the same Marketplace or Quixel/Megascans assets.To prevent us from stepping on each other’s work, It is highly suggested that you create a directory for yourself within the Mods folder and place ALL your assets (including 3rd Party/Marketplace/Quixel/Megascans) there. The Mods folder should look like the following:Content Mods Blueprints Reap YourUsername You will see other folders in here such as Blueprints &amp; Reap. DO NOT edit the files in here. Since you will be visiting your folder frequently I would consider changing the the folder color and adding it your favourites within the Content Browser. You can do this by simply right-clicking the folder here.Your First Map If you have seen previous YouTube tutorials it may have said you need to set up the Render Settings, or modify the Packaging settings. With the latest version of the Template, you do not need to change or extract any settings. You should be good to go from the first time you launch.Bare Essentials for Gameplay Following the previous steps, go to your ...\\Mod\\Username directory in the Content Browser and create a new Level then open it Whatever you name it will be what it shows up as in-game Once opened, on the toolbar click on Blueprints &gt; Open Level Blueprint Under Class Defaults, check the details panel and click on Item Data and add the ItemData asset Click Compile, and you can save and exit the window Under the Place Actors tab, chuck down a Geometry floor and a couple of walls using boxes to act as a space to play in If everything is black, press Alt+3 to switch to Unlit Mode Under the Place Actors tab, go to All Classes and search for and place down the following: 5 Player Start Actors This is where your Player and Team Spawn Nav Mesh Bounds Volume Required for your AI to function, whatever this covers will be where your AI can walk World Data Generator Actor This will build the navigation and gameplay elements when you load your map Roster Scenario Spawner Actor This creates your gameplay objectives and spawns In the Content Browser, navigate to ...\\Content\\BlueprintSpawners\\PostRelease and place down 2 BP_AISpawn_Reap_V1 Blueprints Technically not needed, but without it the map will automatically complete when you play it and you wont be able to test it. You can use the AISpawn actor, but Reap’s one has some better control After you place it down in your map you can search it in the Place Actors tab. Additional ThingsLightingCurrently your level doesn’t have any light, so we should set up the basic stuff so we can actually see when we playtest it. Add the following: Lightmass Importance Volume and adjust it to cover the playable area 1 Directional Light to act as a Sun/Moon Set it to Stationary for dynamic shadows to work properly Under Details &gt; Atmosphere and Cloud enable Atmosphere Sun Light 1 Sky Light Actor 1 Sky Atmosphere Actor 1 Exponential Height Fog Actor 1 Sphere Reflection Probe that encompasses the map Without reflections the models/guns in game can look flat and not properly lit. If you set your Directional Light to be the Atmosphere Sun Light, you can use Ctrl+L to change the direction of your sun nowAISpawnsThe 2 BP_AISpawn_Reap_V1 blueprints that we placed down are not configured yet, so lets do that by adding a Civilian and Suspect: Select an AISpawn and under AISpawn &gt; Spawn Array press the + symbol Expand the new array element and also expand Spawned AI This is where you choose what AI to Spawn To begin with change the Data Table to AIDataTable_Gas &amp; the Row Name to Civilian_Gas_Employee_01 Select the other AISpawn and follow the same steps but change the Row Name to Suspect_01_ShotgunYour AISpawn details should look something similar to this: You can select any Data Table and Row Name for your map and you are not restricted to 1 Data Table.DoorsDoors are pretty simple to place down into your map. In the Content Browser, navigate to ...\\Content\\BlueprintSpawners\\PostRelease and place down a BP_Door_Reap_V1 blueprint Within the Details panel, change the Door Type &gt; Row Name to the sort of Door you would like For testing purposes I like to use Wood_Door_Painted The basic Template does not include the Static Meshes so you can preview the door. To get them you will need to follow the steps in Using Ready or Not Game Assets and Content For the AI to actually use doors and stack up properly, it seems the door needs to be connected to an actual room-like structure (ie: enclosed by 3-4 walls). It’s unclear on the exact requirements at the moment, but this seems to be one of them.LevelDataLevelData will show you how your map will look in the Level/Mission Select screen. Currently LevelData does not work and we are waiting for a patch from VOID.Building / BakingIf you’ve been following along so far, then you probably have not built your map. Building a map fixes up changes in Geometry &amp; Volumes, Lighting &amp; Reflections and Pathing. You should do it whenever you want to update/preview changes in your map.To build your map you simply press the Build button on the toolbar. Once the build completes, you should File &gt; Save All Building times can vary, but the largest determining factor is usually Lighting. As map size increases and the quality of Lighting is changed, builds can take anywhere from 2mins all the way up to 6hrs and longer. At the moment the map should probably only take a couple of seconds.CookingCooking is the process of turning the project into content that can be deployed on other machines. We also only want cook content that is only important for the map to keep file size small. We need to configure this first: Go to Edit &gt; Project Settings and on the side tab select Project &gt; Packaging Under Packaging &gt; List of maps to include in a packaged build you should see an element that shows the directory for Reap’s Example.umap. We want to replace this entry with the directory of our Map.umap. If you do not see List of maps to include in a packaged build you may need to press the arrow that looks like this: Press the + and create another entry here and navigate to your map’s BuildData, it should be in the exact same location as your map. You do not need to change any other settings and it should look something like this: Make sure you Save All before proceeding Select File &gt; Cook Content for Windows This could take some time for your first cook as it compiles all the shaders. Just be patient. You should hear it succeed, but a message will not remain on screen when it completes. If it failed the notification will stay on the screen. A common cause of a failed Cook is usual a result of including already Cooked content from this process, so make sure you haven’t included it in any of your directories. Even creating materials that reference cooked textures will create a cook to fail.Packaging &amp; Installing your MapPackaging will turn our cooked content into a single compressed file that we can actually use to play in game and distribute to other people. There are a bunch of Unreal packers out in the wild, but only use the following method for maps. Create a folder somewhere to act as your staging location for packing, name doesn’t matter but I use Paking. Within this folder create a new folder using the following naming convention: pakchunk99-YOURMAPNAME the 99 after pakchunk indicates the load order of paks. We keep maps at 99. Replace YOURMAPNAME with whatever your map’s name is. This will not show up in game, but will help identify your map/mod to people downloading your mod. Sometimes it is required to append _P at the end of the name if you are replacing files (i.e. P for Patching). But since you shouldn’t be replacing any files this is unneeded. Go to C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\\UE_4.27\\Engine\\Binaries\\Win64 and create a .bat file here with the following arguments: @if \"%~1\"==\"\" goto skip @setlocal enableextensions @pushd %~dp0 @echo \"%~1\\*.*\" \"../../../ReadyOrNot/\" &gt;filelist.txt .\\UnrealPak.exe \"%~1.pak\" -create=filelist.txt -compress @popd @pause :skip Create a Shortcut to the .bat file you created and move it to your staging folder from step 1. Navigate to your Template/Project folder and go to: ...\\RoNTemplate\\Saved\\Cooked\\WindowsNoEditor\\ReadyOrNot and copy ONLY the Content folder Paste your Content folder into your pakchunk99-YOURMAPNAME folder Drag your pakchunk99-YOURMAPNAME folder onto your .bat shortcut. A command window will pop up and tell you when it is complete. If successful you should have a new file in your staging directory named pakchunk99-YOURMAPNAME.pak Copy your pakchunk99-YOURMAPNAME.pak to C:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Ready Or Not\\ReadyOrNot\\Content\\Paks Your map should now be available in the gameThis is an example of what a Staging folder can look like: You will be jumping between these folders a lot, I really recommend putting your Staging folder, Project Cooked folder Ready or Not Pak directory to your Quick Access bar.Testing your Map I highly recommend that you download the Console Unlocker - Camera Mod by QuantumNuke75. It will give you ability to use a Free-Look camera and also use basic Unreal Engine Console Commands. Both functions are extremely helpful for testing.The easiest way to test your map is to simply load up the game and select it from the Mission Select screen. If all works well then it should take a couple of seconds to build WorldGen and plops you into the map.If you installed the Console Unlocker mod, you can also load into it faster by hitting ~ and typing open YOURMAPNAME and pressing execute. YOURMAPNAME should be what the .umap name is called within your project. NOT the package name. For Hell Comes to the Hills the command for opening it is open Hell_Comes_to_the_Hills.Common Issues with a Map not LoadingMake sure you did the following: Using the up-to-date version of the template linked above in this guide. You are using the packing method described above in this guide. Only include the Content folder from \\RoNTemplate\\Saved\\Cooked\\WindowsNoEditor\\ReadyOrNot You have all the actors mentioned in Bare Essentials for Gameplay.If your map is still not not launching, then you may want to reach out for help on the Mapping Discord linked above.Updating your Map after PlaytestingAnd Voilà! You’ve just gone through your first iteration of RoN Mapping!There are just some final important steps needed to know when you re-cook and package your map to test updates: After you recook your map, it is recommended that you delete the Content folder within your staged pakchunk99-YOURMAPNAME folder instead of overriding it. Overriding your folders may leave residual files and settings that may mess with your playtest BEFORE you launch the game. Navigate to C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\ReadyOrNot\\Saved\\SaveGames and delete the WorldGen.sav file that has the same map name as your map (e.g. Hell Comes to the Hills filename looks like Hell_Comes_to_the_Hills_WorldGen_40173.sav). This step is critical! Each time the game launches your map for the first time, it generates World Data and stores it so the map launches faster the next time you play it. However the game does not know when your map has been changed. So you will likely be playing on a map with outdated build information resulting in quite a few bugs. The WorldGen contains information such as how doors are positions and connected, room sizes and layouts, stacking points, navigation, hiding spots and cover and a probably a lot of other things we don’t know about yet. So it is important to make sure you generate new World data with each iteration! Just like with the other folders, it is recommended you add the SaveGames directory to your quick access, as you will be visiting it quite a fair bit!Using Ready or Not Game Assets and ContentIf you want to use RoN game assets you will need to extract them yourself using umodel: https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodelTo get the assets: Open umodel and select your ...\\ReadyOrNot\\Content\\Paks folder Click Tools &gt; Scan Content and select Unreal Engine 4.27 Tick Flat View in the top-left corner. Sort by Stat (Static Meshes) Select all with Stat = 1 Select Tools &gt; Save Selected PackagesYou can repeat steps 4-6 for Skel (Skeletal Meshes)Once you are done copy the saved files to your project. For umodel the Game folder is the Content folder for your Project. So you can just copy the contents of Game into your Content folder.Restarting the Editor may take some time as the project discovers and indexes all the cooked assets.You can simply place down these meshes in your level but they may not have materials. However, when you load the game they will be textured fine. This is just a limitation we need to work around. Make sure you are keeping the directories the same from Game to Content. Cooked assets are the actual game files the game needs to reference for them to work. Do not put them in your Mods\\Username folder. You may want to repeat for some Tex (Textures) as well. But be warned that you will not have the materials to display onto the meshes. You will need rebuild the materials from scratch, and saving the Textures is not usually worth the time and hassle. It is generally not recommended to extract/save everything as it will take a very long time to do and will likely crash/fail to do so. Putting ALL the assets into your project will also significantly increase file size &amp; launching time when you open UE. If for some reason the assets are not loading double check the project settings so that it can use cooked content: https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/WorkingWithContent/CookedContentVideo Guide by Reap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQKyV7_6fE" }, { "title": "Quick Cook Setup", "url": "/posts/quickcook/", "categories": "Map Modding", "tags": "maps", "date": "2023-01-18 23:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "This is a guide to setup and use the quick cook editor scripting widget.The widget automates repetitive cooking, copying, paking and starting the game to load a specific level.

Content is the base folder your UE4 projects starts from.YourProjectName is only a placeholder for what you name your project when you make it in the New Project menu in Epic’s UE4 Launcher.The project name for the Meth house map for example is listed as RoN_Meth.To make a map you should start by downloading the newly updated Covered Bones Mapping template from NexusIt includes all the C++ files and Folder Structs like listed below and should provide you with a strong basis to start map modding.The Folder struct below is only the nessescary files required for the map to work (using all features) but the Covered Bones includes more files for conveniency.To distinguish the old Bare Bones from the new updated template, it’s now called Covered Bones.Content BlueprintSpawners BP_Door.uasset bp_door_reap.uasset CustomGameModeOverride.uasset BP_GameModeOverride.uasset BombSpawner.uasset BP_SpawnEvidence.uasset BP_SpawnActor.uasset BP_SpawnSelectedActor.uasset Blueprints DataTables DoorDataTable.uasset DoorType.uasset TrapDataTable.uasset AI_DataTable.uasset AI_DataTable_V3.uasset AI AI_DataTable_Club.uasset AI_DataTable_DataCenter.uasset AI_DataTable_Dealer.uasset AI_DataTable_Farm.uasset AI_DataTable_Gas.uasset AI_DataTable_Hospital.uasset AI_DataTable_Hotel.uasset AI_DataTable_Importer.uasset AI_DataTable_Meth.uasset AI_DataTable_Penthouse.uasset AI_DataTable_Port.uasset AI_DataTable_Ridgeline.uasset AI_DataTable_Valley.uasset Environment BP_Door_New.uasset IncapacitatedHuman.uasset Gameplay COOP BP_BombActor.uasset COOPModes GM_COOP_ActiveShooter GM_COOP_BarricadedSuspects GM_COOP_BombThreat GM_COOP_HostageRescue GM_COOP_Raid Games GM_COOP.uasset Logic MethLogic BP_Evidence_Meth_Contraband.uasset BP_Evidence_Meth_Contraband_2.uasset PortLogic BP_Evidence_Port_Dossier.uasset RidgelineLogic BP_Evidence_Ridgeline_Ricin.uasset ValleyLogic BP_Evidence_Valley_HardDrive.uasset BP_Evidence_Valley_HardDrive_02.uasset BP_Evidence_Valley_Laptop.uasset Sound Unused ModMusic_BP.uasset ModSound_BP.uasset E_WorldGenType.uasset FMOD // Sound banks and events located here Mods YourProjectName (CoveredBones) Levels // To make your level appear mod main menu place it here: YourMapName.umap YourMapName_BuildData.uasset MoreDoor.umap MoreDoor_BuildData.uasset // Custom models, materials and textures are placed here in sorted folders. ReadyOrNot Data // Misc useful data items are located here Project SettingsProject settings are important when making maps. They tell the engine how to interact with the assets and how they are cooked. When making maps you will need to change some of these to fit what content you want to include in your map. Some of the stuff are not optional. They will break certain elements of your game if they’re cooked. Don’t worry though - it’s nothing permanent.Go to the top to Settings drop down button and pick Project Settings (2nd from the top).Navigate to Packaging and scroll down to Ini Section Blacklist - there will be a tiny bar with an arrow on it to expand the menu further. Click on it and scroll down to Directories To Never Cook and add 2 array elements. Edit them with the 3 dots to this:The Folders in the Bare Bones Template that need this treatment are:(!! Ignore the /Game/Materials and /Game/ReadyOrNot/Assets/Shared if they’re not there !!)For custom materials to work we need to edit some Packaging settings that can be found in Project Settings.Look for the tick box called Share Material Shader Code and make sure it is NOT ticked. It should be ticked off in the BB template by default.You’re then free to use all kinds of materials with both translucency and emissive properties without the need of instancing game master materials, making Quixel and Megascans importing a lot more user friendly.GameModesBlueprints must be constructed manually as no blueprints can be imported from the base game.With the Bare Bones project the gamemode blueprint will be called GM_COOP.If you don’t have one, create an empty GameMode from the GameMode base class and rename it, then place it in the corresponding folder structure listed above.GameMode Override:At the top of your editor screen you will find the Blueprints tab, where you can edit Asset Blueprints and World Blueprints. In order for your game to work you must override the default gamemode and pick World Override: and pick the GM_COOP gamemode blueprint class.I have added a new way to set the gamemode as by default the game comes with Barricaded Suspects and Raid as the only available game modes. This tool is found in BlueprintSpawners and is called GameModeOverride. It does what it says - override the gamemode - and thus that gamemode will be the only gamemode for the level, despite what it says on the map in the lobby. This asset is dragged out somewhere in your level (doesn’t matter where) and you select your intended game mode and provide the literal map name as it appears top left on the tab in the editor. If you want the game to be Bomb Threat you should also add up to 2 BombSpawner.uassets in your level that spawns vanilla game defusable bombs in the level.World Geometry:If you make a new level instead of using the template’s included test map, just note that the standard level of UE4 includes a floor which is a static mesh. This will usually not show up in-game and you’ll fall through the world upon launch.If you want static / physics meshes in your world you must either reference base game meshes under the ReadyOrNot folder or provide your own in the correct folders.For prototyping or if you don’t have access to a lot of high poly assets it can be desirable to use BSP brushes. These are usually just convex hull geometry that you can piece together. You can actually make most of your map with this, then add models to enhance the level afterwards. I included some basic materials too to get you going.To make a walkable floor you have to use the Place Actor menu’s Geometry tab and choose the Box primitive.Use the right side menu to adjust the size of the floor or use the Brush Editing Mode (Shift + 4) to adjust the shape and size of your primitive.You only really need a floor, but it can be favorable to include walls and ceilings to get a sense of scale as well as for AI generation.A trick would be to use the included SM_Farm_Door_A door model to align doorways and ceilings for the scale.LightingInclude at least one light if not using the “sun” light standard to the scene. This helps bake the correct lightdata on your geometry. Without any light you can sometimes recieve weird shadow artifacts or weird colors. This also helps those weird people who don’t put any attachments on their guns.I added the GoodSky asset pack from UE4 Marketplace into the template, because it’s really handy to configure day/night using it; even adding a thunderstorm in a few clicks.In addition to that you’d need to place a Directional Light into the level for the actual light.You can add multiple lights in your scene, but adjust the Attenuation Radius so that too many don’t overlap. UE4 is very limited when it comes to light overlapping, so you’ll need to tinker with this to get a good feel for it.If a red X is displayed on the light it will not render in the final product or be glitched.World Generation and AI NavigationWorld Gen:This is probably one of the more complex steps as it involves messing a bit with the World Blueprint so I made the title a bit bigger.In the new update the devs added world generation to custom maps so I will need to test a bit with that, but the previous way to go was to include RosterScenarioSpawner and WorldDataGenerator C++ Actors in the map so that they would generate these points. The Bare Bones template should already have this included but if it doesn’t or you create a new map from scratch you’ll need to add these manually by going to the bottom of the Content section and look for C++ Classes and dragging these out into your world.(Still need to add more info to this chapter - unfinished)Navigation:To make the AI know which part of your map is intended to walk on you’ll need to set up a volume that touches the floor that you want them to be able to navigate.This volume is called Nav Mesh Bounds Volume and can be found in the Volumes Tab in Place Actors. This volume should ideally intersect the walkable floor. Navigation area only generates inside of this volume so make sure that all your walkable floor is encompassed in this volume. It also doesn’t matter if the volume is sticking out underneath of the floor or is not the same size, the engine pulls navigation info from the Project Settings when it generates paths.After building the paths from the Build button you can display the walkable paths generated by pressing P.Adding Props / Models Locate the prop[s] that you want to use on your map. These will have the .uasset format as any other file. However, make sure the .uasset you are looking at is the static mesh, not texture file or anything else. You can verify this by opening that file in UModel. If the class says StaticMesh, you’re good to go.An easier route is to download the Mapping Reference Project made by RareKiwi and delete the assets from folder after cooking. Make the folder struct the same as the asset file path. Go to Place Actors &gt; Basic and drag the Cube to the Content Browser and click Copy Here. You can use this in your level wherever and upon loading into your map, this will turn into the appropriate asset. Only go beyond this step if you want to see the asset within the editor. Export the static mesh you want to use as a .psk using UModel. Using Blender and the .psk plugin for it, export the model as a .fbx. Import the .fbx into UE4 with the same name as the asset you are attempting to use within your map. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the sibling file in the game files.Adding DoorsTo get a door into the game you place all the provided files into the folder structure as shown above.Set up the BP_Door in the Blueprint Editor under BeginPlay like this:Blueprint Pastebin - BP_DoorThis will make a BP_Door_New entity be spawned at the location of this blueprint with all the provided variables from BP_Door.The BP_Door gets these variables from the DoorDataTable and the TrapDataTable - so if you can’t see these variables be sure to look on the right side and see that the Data Table is linked to the blueprint.The red arrow in the BP shows which way the trap will be placed and marks the back side of the door. Place an instance of BP_Door onto the map and change the desired values: Door Type: Use the DoorDataTable in the data table block and select the wanted door. Trap Type: Doors can have pre-attached traps. The types to choose from comes from the TrapDataTable and are Explosive, Flashbang, Alarm, NoTrap. Note that the NoTrap doesn’t disable the trap, it makes it random. Lockchance, can be 0.0 - 1.0 We’re unsure if this value does anything, but we would expect higher probability of locking the closer to 1. Lockable: If the door can be locked or not. If you want a door to always be open you tick this box to False. NoSpawnTrap: If ticked it will disable any traps from pre-attaching to this door. Leave unticked if you want the TrapType to propigate. UseBrokenDoorMesh: We’re unsure if this does anything other than spawning the ruined door from the training course in the lobby map. MinOpenClose / MaxOpenClose: Probably has something to do with the max angle the door can swing, but I have yet to notice any difference after changing these values.. Evidence ActorsIf you’ve played the game for more than 5 minutes you may have come across the different kinds of evidence that you can pick up in the world. These are the smaller kinds of objects that are linked to drugs, videos/photos, lists and more. In the new Covered Bones there is a provided blueprint to spawn these kinds of actors.Simply drag out one BP_SpawnEvidence.uasset per evidence actor into your desired location in your map, and select your preferred evidence (oh and due to my negligence the white and red meth bags were swapped on the list - whoops)The evidence types should have intuitive icons when you select between them :)MultiplayerMultiplayer works by default if you place enough spawn points in your map. This spawn point is called PlayerStart and you’ll need at least 5 for normal multiplayer function.Building and CookingAt this point the map should be ready for rendering and packaging (you don’t really need doors but maps are very lacklusting without).You firstly need to Build the data into the map by pressing the Build button at the top of the screen. It will take some time to finish.Once it is done you can cook the files.You cook the map so that the game can recognise the level as a playable map.Before cooking be sure to select the Content folder as the cooker will cook everything down from that folder.Go to top left at File and choose under Project -&gt; Cook Content For Windows.The cooked project will be located in your projects folder under &lt;yourprojectname&gt;/Saved/Cooked/WindowsNoEditor/To make the map appear in game you must pak the project folder with the pak bat file mentioned in The Basics.Only pak the Project folder with the Content folder inside, not the MetaData or AssetRegistry and it should work from the mat :)Name the pak to pakchunk99-Mods-&lt;yourprojectname&gt;_P - Replace the brackets and what’s in them with your project’s name.For now, delete the FMOD folder from your cooked folder unless you are testing FMOD stuff. And if you do, delete everything except your custom banks and events.If you don’t delete game-default assets everything from the game will be overwritten with empty data since the banks in this folder are only for reference.That will result in your game having no sound other than VO.MaterialsTo “paint” your walls/models/etc. you’ll need it to display a material. A material in UE4 is a set of textures layered on top of eachother to display color, depth and light interaction. Inside the asset it uses a block with nodes attached to it to get the information. This information is set up in a visual Blueprint form to make the process easier.You drag connections between the material attributes nodes to link them together. I have added a TV simulated material woth a bunch of cool layering to convey a realistic look that you’re free to use, mix n’ match.To paint an object you can drag the material from the content browser out onto the surface directly or use the side menus and select multiple surfaces to paint at the same time.Chapter not finished.Post Processing and visual techPost processing in UE4 is the method to give your maps the extra umph and sell the immersion visually. It’s how you get areas to feel different and lift the ambience for the player. The goal of post processing is to enhance what’s already there to reflect your intended visuals. I might be a little cryptic here, but that’s for the better.Let’s examplify this: If your lore is set in the Middle East it would not make sense that the light has the same color as it does further north like UK, it might be a little orange-shifted to give the “desert-feel”. Maybe you want some fog and haze to emulate distant sandstorms.Or enhanced clarity. Maybe the lighting is dialed in right for realism, but has the wrong color, saturation and contrast. Take a look at this basic example:I can’t tell you what exactly you should do for your map to look real. It is very contextual, so it varies from map to map. But I can tell you how certain elements work to achieve some effects. The first element that you should have to enable custom post processing is most obviously a Post Process Volume actor. It allows you to change a lot of values regarding filmic and rendering. It contains a long set of variables that you can change to get the desired effects:For the most part we will use what’s in the Color Grading section, because it has the most effect. Scrolling down to Color Grading Changing Temperature, Tint and Saturation, Contrast, Gain, Gamma will be our main focus point. Most scene “moods” can be achieved here..Note that the effects in Global has a drop down to change overall values more specifically, and for the most part we should only care about the slider under the color-cirle to change the value of that parameter. If you need to do some color balancing in that area you’d mostly want to do it in Saturation and Gain.FMOD Sound Integation(WIP)For this you’ll need FMOD for UE4 If you don’t know how to install FMOD visit the RoN Custom Maps Discord and check out the Guides Links or watch THIS VIDEOWhen you have installed FMOD correctly, you can make sound come into your map by placing a FMOD Audio Player from the Place Actors menu. You’ll also need to reference a sound that’s already in game* for it to play. If you want this sound to always play regardless of your location (like theme music) you don’t really need to do anything but to check that the “Start Activated” checkbox is ticked.To get the sounds from Ready Or Not into unreal editor for referencing and preview (yes you can preview the audio!) you need to copy over some banks from the game’s directory into your project. Navigate to your Steam/Steamapps/Common/Ready Or Not/ReadyOrNot/Content/FMOD/Desktop folder and select all the bank files in the folder and copy them.Then go to your project and go to the Content/FMOD/Desktop folder and paste in the banks…Navigate to the Events folder to verify that it works, you should be able to double-click an asset and preview the sound in the editor.If you want to make a dynamically changing ambience based on the area you enter you will need to use a simple blueprint actor for this. I covered that briefly in the video above, but the idea is to blend or stop all other ambiences when you step into a new one. Using a box collision that only overlaps the Pawn channel will make the triggering happen. To fade in a sound you can use a timeline to manipulate the volume but ideally you want to fade in based on the distance to the other ambience actor but for normal cues 2 seconds of fade time will do.For sound transitioning there is a transitioning volume located in Mods/Audio/Atmos that you can use to simplify this process - with that actor you can select what sound you transition to and from and you can walk back and forth through it. Place down the default ambience actor too for the sound to be played when u spawn into the level.### Custom Sounds! So there is a way to get custom sounds and music playing in game right now and will be standard with the next release version of the Covered Bones Template. For now I will link the assets you need to make this work. You still need the FMOD plugin for this. Thanks to RareKiwi#5360 and crazy4videogames#3909 for figuring out the last steps of this puzzle!#### Audio Files Setup: Make a new folder in your main (Content) folder and name it something like MySpicyAudio or something you can remember. Go to the Explorer window in Windows where you can see the files and browse to your covered bones project and go into the MySpicyAudio folder. Drag out your preferred sound (.wav, .mp3 or .ogg formats) and put it into the folder like shown below:The default wave sound file that will be included in the upcoming version of bare bones will be a 1 second long clip of a fire alarm, just to show it working:Unreal Editor will prompt you about importing the asset, so just click Import and it should appear in the Content menu. If you have set the sound up correctly you should see that the source file says FireAlarm.wav and that the path says /Game/MySpicyAudio and not the path to the location you imported it from or else it won’t play.Sound Blueprints Setup:Once you have obtained a file to play you will need to create a folder path (if it doesn’t already exist!) that will look like: Mods/Blueprints/Sound/Unused!Note that it should be in the Mods folder. Other locations might not work or cause the blueprints to misbehave…Game music needs to be fixed before I upload the ModMusic_BP, but you can download the ModSound_BP and the FireAlarm.wav here (extract in Content folder): ZIP file archiveUsing The Blueprint:Drag the blueprint out in the world where you want it to play from - a fire alarm usually plays best from above head height.In the details panel on the side you can edit some of the parameters; if it should loop, if it’s 3D (not playing everywhere) and more settings related to the max audible distance. Amongst these settings you need to set the Sound To Use as a Sound Name - The way to set up the sound name is to reference its location, name and file extension. So for the included fire alarm file you should change the name to MySpicyAudio/FireAlarm.wav - any other file you add to your custom audio folder would need to be set up the same way.If it works in the editor it will most likely work in game too. Re-cook the build and verify that the sound files and bp’s were copied over. Look in the discord and ask if you’re getting stuck :)" }, { "title": "The Basics", "url": "/posts/thebasics/", "categories": "General Information", "tags": "essential, batch", "date": "2022-07-20 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Important InformationUnderstanding the File StructureWhen creating a project in Unreal Engine 4, the project will be saved to a directory. Within that directory will be the project. For example: &lt;SaveDirectory&gt;/&lt;ProjectName&gt;/…. &lt;ProjectName&gt; houses all of the contents of the Unreal Engine 4 project. In that project folder, there will be a subfolder named Content. That folder houses all of the assets and blueprints within a game.In the case of Ready or Not, the project name is ReadyOrNot. Within that folder, there is a folder called Content. Again, this houses everything inside a game except for configuration files. However, when you open the game files in UModel, there may not be a Content folder, instead, it’ll have been replaced with a Game folder. When .paking your mod, you should replace Game with Content. Any of the sub folders will remain the same.The majority of the modding that you will do will be under the Content folder. If a file that you are looking to override is in .../ReadyOrNot/Game/ReadyOrNot/Assets/Weapons/Python, the file path to copy would be .../Content/ReadyOrNot/Assets/Weapons/Python. Failure to copy the exact path of Ready or Not will result in a broken mod.File FormatsThere are multiple different file formats that you may encounter while modding. Here is a list of most of them, and what each of them are. .psk - A skeletal or static mesh. May contain the skeleton. .psa - An animation for a specific mesh. .uasset - Two types. Raw .uasset files are the ones created after cooking a UE4 project. UE4 .uasset files are the ones that are taken directly from a UE4 project, they are uncooked and can be transferred between projects. .uexp - An raw complementary file to uassets, usually containing import and export maps. .ubulk - Another data storage file that UE4 uses. .umap - A level/map file, similar to .uasset in the way that there is an uncooked and cooked version.EssentialsExtracting Game FilesThere are two methods of extracting games files, both have important differences: UModel. This program can extract non-raw files, allowing you to gain access to textures, models, and animations. To use it, direct it towards the location of the .pak files within Ready or Not: &lt;GameInstallLocation&gt;\\Ready Or Not\\ReadyOrNot\\Content\\Paks. You’ll be able to extract individual assets once loaded. Manual unpaking. This can be done simply by setting up an unpak batch script. Create a .bat file in your UnrealPak install location (located within your Unreal Engine 4 install), usually &lt;InstallLocation&gt;\\UE_4.27\\Engine\\Binaries\\Win64\\UnrealPak.exe. In the .bat file, paste the following lines in and save: @if \"%~1\"==\"\" goto skip @setlocal enableextensions @pushd %~dp0 .\\UnrealPak.exe %1 -extract \"%~n1\" @popd @pause :skip Drag the .pak file you want to unpak, for example pakchunk0-WindownNoEditor_0_P, directly onto the .bat file you just created. This will extract the pak’s files in the same location as the batch file. Cooking Modified FilesIn order to override any assets within the game or add new content, the files must be in a format that the game can recognize. The files you extracted via UModel will be in a format that is easily accessible by you, not the game. You will first need to cook these before PAKing the files. Install the latest version of Unreal Engine 4.27. The current latest version is 4.27.2. Import all the files you want to pack with your mod into a new blank project. Any other template can work, but will result in significantly longer cooking times. Go to File &gt; Cook Content for Windows. This converts the files into a UE4 exported format (*.uasset, *.uexp, *.ubulk). Retrieve the cooked files in &lt;ProjectLocation/&gt;&lt;ProjectName&gt;/Saved/Cooked/WindowsNoEditor/.Creating a PAK File Make sure the folder you are paking, for example pakchunk99-Mods_MyMod_P, contains the same file structure as Ready or Not. Also ensure that _P is at the end of your pak name. Not doing so will likely result in the mod not loading. The number after pakchunk indicates the load order of the .pak. Make sure to understand the directory structure first, before paking your mod. Incorrect directory structure will lead to issues. Your structure should mimic something like this: pakchunk99-Mods_MyMod/Content/ReadyOrNot/Assets/…. Create a .bat file in your UnrealPak install location (located within your Unreal Engine 4 install), usually &lt;InstallLocation&gt;\\UE_4.27\\Engine\\Binaries\\Win64\\UnrealPak.exe. In the .bat file, paste the following lines in and save: @if \"%~1\"==\"\" goto skip@setlocal enableextensions@pushd %~dp0@echo \"%~1\\*.*\" \"../../../ReadyOrNot/\" &gt;filelist.txt.\\UnrealPak.exe \"%~1.pak\" -create=filelist.txt -compress@popd@pause:skip Drag the folder you want to PAK, for example pakchunk99-Mods_MyMod_P, directly onto the .bat file you just created. This will create a .pak file in the same directory as the folder you just dragged. If the .pak file size is 1 KB, change the locations of the contents you are attempting to pak.Additional InformationMod InstallationAll .pak mods go here. &lt;GameInstallLocation&gt;\\Ready Or Not\\ReadyOrNot\\Content\\Paks. Ensure that the .pak load order is correct.Example ModTo see if your PAKing is working, download this example mod. This will turn your gun on the main menu pink if the .pak is correctly PAKed. Download and extract the .zip file before PAKing.DebuggingIf your mod is not working, make sure to check these common error points: Check the file strucuture. This must perfectly match the files within the game, otherwise it will not load. No _P at the end of the mod name. This is needed when a patch pak is used for the main game files. Load order. Incorrecy load order may cause issues between mods, change the numberical elements of the pak name to change the load order. Mount point (The best way to debug any issues is to use the builtin UnrealPak.exe. Simply open this with cmd with the line: unreakpak.exe -List This_Is_A_Pak.pak. Look at the mounting point. The mounting point will be the deepest folder that encapulates all of your content. If it is not, you may have an issue.)" }, { "title": "UAsset Modding", "url": "/posts/uassetmodding/", "categories": "UAsset Modding", "tags": "uasset", "date": "2022-07-19 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "UAsset Modding [UE5.3] UassetGUI now needs a Mappings.usmap for full functionalityTo do UAsset modding, you’ll need to be able to extract the raw files from the game.

Open UAssetGUI and open the UAsset file you wish to edit. On the left side you’ll see a series of dropdowns. Within these, you’ll find various structs that you can edit. Find the struct that you would like to edit, and find the value within that you would like to change. Change the value. Save the file to anywhere. Two files will have been created, a .uasset and a .uexp, make sure to pak both of these files into your .pak mod in the correct location.Adding DataThis can be a very complicated portion of modding. Make sure to read all of this very carefully. This section will be specific in what to do and what to not do, but will not explain everything, as each file can be a little different. As long as you make sure the imports are correct and that you added the data correctly, the file should work. Open the UAsset file in UAssetGUI. Export the JSON file, and open that file in a text editor of your choice. I would suggest using Notepad++ and the JSON Parser plugin. This will let you auto-format the JSON file. When adding data, you’ll need to copy and paste whatever data you’re trying to add more of. If if this is a new item in ItemDataTable.uasset, then you’ll need to copy another item in the datatable. Copy and paste whatever you would like to duplicate into the correct location. Keep in mind all of the commas and brackets. If you see a negative number that doesn’t correlate to coordinates, or scale, or rotation, this is an import reference. If you open Import Data located in the left pane of UAssetGUI, you’ll see a bunch of negative numbers in the first column and other data stored in rows. This is the \t portion of the file that contains all the references and imports the file uses. Also within this file, you’ll see a column label called OuterIndex. This column will also contain a bunch of negative nunber and 0s. The 0s indicate that the row is not a child of another row. If this row contains a negative number within that column, then that row depends on another dependency. You can find this dependency as you would any other import, locatin the row with said negative number. When adding a reference from the game, it’s a good idea to copy and paste similar references and then change the strings slightly. This ensures that you will retain the correct formatting. You can add this reference either in the JSON file or in UAssetGUI. Both are better in different scenarios. If you’re going to add a bunch of imports, use the JSON file, otherwise use UAssetGUI. Save the JSON file with all your edits and open that JSON file in UAssetGUI. If you get an error, you messed up the JSON formatting. If you have made all your data additions and made sure to have the proper imports (you may need to import multiple times for just one thing), then the mod should work. You can tell if it’s working if the game does’t freeze or crash on launch (wait until the intro screen ends). If this occurs there is a high chance you messed up something with the imports." }, { "title": "UAsset Automation", "url": "/posts/uassetautomation/", "categories": "UAsset Modding", "tags": "uasset, python, automation", "date": "2022-07-19 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "UAsset AutomationJSON Parsing via PythonOnce you have a firm understanding of manually editing UAssets, you can semi-easily automate tasks. To start, you’ll need some Python, or other programming knowledge. I’ll be using Python for this tutorial because of the simple to use json library that comes with Python 3+. I highly recommend doing this if you need to change a lot of data every time the game updates. If you would like specific help with this, ask QuantumNuke75#3593 on Discord. Note that the code down below may not be pretty, as it’s gone under numerous changes as the game updates.Ammo ModYour first line should be the import statement.import jsonNext, you’ll want to open the file. To do this, replace FILE_NAME with the location of your JSON file that you extracted with UAssetGUI.file = open('FILE_NAME')At the bottom of the file, you’ll want to export your JSON file, which you can then load back up in UAssetGUI and save it as a .uasset.json.dump(data, open(\"export.json\", \"w\"))But, you’ll then want to load this file as a JSON file. data will become a Python dictionary.data = json.load(file)Within this data variable will be layers of dictionaries, lists, and key-value pairs witin the dictionaries. From this, you’ll be able to easily automate adding, data, changing values, or anything. Now we’ll need to loop through every item in the export datatable, which is where the majority of the data we need is held.for item in data[\"Exports\"][0][\"Table\"][\"Data\"]:Now we need to loop through every value for every item, since the ammo count for a gun is just one of many values an item has.\tfor item_data in item[\"Value\"]:Now, we check for specific tags, in our case, these tags are MagazineCountDefault(0) and MagazineCountMax(0). Once we’ve found these tags, we can set the values of these to whatever we want. In this specific case, the code is getting the value, and adding a number of mags to it.\t\tif item_data[\"Name\"] == \"MagazineCountDefault(0)\": amount = int(item_data[\"Value\"]) if 3 &lt; amount &lt; 30: item_data[\"Value\"] = num_mags continue if item_data[\"Name\"] == \"MagazineCountMax(0)\": amount = int(item_data[\"Value\"]) if 3 &lt; amount &lt; 30: item_data[\"Value\"] = num_mags continueThe full code is below:import jsonnum_mags = 15file = open('ItemDataTable.json')data = json.load(file)# For every item in the export table.for item in data[\"Exports\"][0][\"Table\"][\"Data\"]: # For every piece of the item data. for item_data in item[\"Value\"]: # If the item's name is MagazineCount if item_data[\"Name\"] == \"MagazineCountDefault(0)\": amount = int(item_data[\"Value\"]) if 3 &lt; amount &lt; 30: item_data[\"Value\"] = num_mags continue if item_data[\"Name\"] == \"MagazineCountMax(0)\": amount = int(item_data[\"Value\"]) if 3 &lt; amount &lt; 30: item_data[\"Value\"] = num_mags continuejson.dump(data, open(f\"ammo_export_{num_mags}.json\", \"w\")) More Ammo is an outdated mod, and this code will no longer effect anything in the game.Everything UnlockedI’ll be skipping basic portions of parsing, and will explain more complicated changes instead. Adding data with this method is significantly harder than just changing values. There are two different files we need to edit for Everything Unlocked, ItemDataTable.uasset and ItemData.uasset.ItemDataIn order to add entries to the ItemData we’ll need know what data to add. Every weapon has the following distinct attributes: name, gun blueprint location, default class name, class name, and the item type. In order to make this easier, a struct class was created.class ItemDataStruct: def __init__(self, name, location, default, clas, type): self.name = name self.location = location self.default = default self.clas = clas self.type = typeThis class holds all the information needed to add a specific gun. Now, we need to add a bunch of values. Since we are adding both primary weapons, secondary weapons, tacticals, and helmets accessory options, it’s important to distinguish them all. We’ll store each category of items in their separate arrays.primary_weapons = []primary_weapons.append(ItemDataStruct(\"P90\", \"/Game/Blueprints/Items/WeaponsRevised/Primary_P90(0)\", \"Default__Primary_P90_C(0)\", \"Primary_P90_C(0)\", \"SMG\"))primary_weapons.append(ItemDataStruct(\"Primary_M16A4\", \"/Game/Blueprints/Items/WeaponsRevised/Primary_M16A4(0)\", \"Default__Primary_M16A4_C(0)\", \"Primary_M16A4_C(0)\", \"AR\"))primary_weapons.append(ItemDataStruct(\"Primary_Saiga12\", \"/Game/Blueprints/Items/WeaponsRevised/Primary_Saiga12(0)\", \"Default__Primary_Saiga12_C(0)\", \"Primary_Saiga12_C(0)\", \"Shotgun\"))secondary_weapons = []secondary_weapons.append(ItemDataStruct(\"P250\", \"/Game/Blueprints/Items/WeaponsRevised/Secondary_P250(0)\", \"Default__Secondary_P250_C(0)\", \"Secondary_P250_C(0)\", \"Pistol\"))tacticals = []tacticals.append(ItemDataStruct(\"9Banger\", \"/Game/Blueprints/Items/WeaponsRevised/Grenade_9Banger_V2(0)\", \"Default__Grenade_9Banger_V2_C(0)\", \"Grenade_9Banger_V2_C(0)\", \"Grenade\"))helmets = []helmets.append(ItemDataStruct(\"Helmet_UpArmor\", \"/Game/Blueprints/Items/ArmorRevised/Helmet_UpArmor(0)\", \"Default__Helmet_UpArmor_C(0)\", \"Helmet_UpArmor_C(0)\", \"Helmet\"))Now we can begin parsing through the data. Similarly to More Ammo, we’ll be accessing the data in the same way but instead we’ll checking if the item is a PrimaryWeapons(0), SecondaryWeapon(0), TacticalItems(0), or HeadSelection(0).if items[\"Name\"] == \"PrimaryWeapons(0)\":elif items[\"Name\"] == \"SecondaryWeapons(0)\":elif items[\"Name\"] == \"TacticalItems(0)\":elif items[\"Name\"] == \"HeadSelection(0)\":I’ll only be covering how to automate the primary weapons to prevent this guide from getting longer. Each category is very similar, with some slight changes. Once we’ve establish that we’re in the PrimaryWeapons(0) category, we can begin making changes. Now we can parse through all the weapon structs we created for primary weapons.for weapon_struct in primary_weapons:The second thing we’ll need to to is add the imports. Without imports, the game will have no idea what you’ve added to the table.

To start, you’ll need a dictionary of attachments mapped to their respective socket for each category of attachment: sight, muzzle, underbarrel. You’ll also need a dictionary of item names, mapped to a list of sockets they have.Here’s an example of the underbarrel attachment list, which we’ll be using as an example:all_under = {-38:\"combat_grip\",-39:\"combat_grip\",-65:\"mp5_foregrip\",-66:\"mp5_foregrip\",-70:\"mp5_foregrip\",-81:\"light_socket\",-82:\"laser_socket\",-83:\"laser_socket\",-86:\"foregrip_socket\",-87:\"afg_mlok_grip\",-90:\"foregrip_socket\",-91:\"pointer_socket\",-92:\"pointer_socket\",-102:\"foregrip_VFG_socket\",-103:\"foregrip_socket\",-104:\"vfg_mlok_grip\",-136:\"foregrip_socket\"}And here’s an example of the weapon names mapped to attachments (Note: This list may be outdated.):weapon_to_attachments = {'M1911A1':{'RMRPistol_Socket', 'comp_socket', 'supressor_socket', 'light_socket', 'laser_socket', 'SROPistol_Socket', 'flash_socket', 'Reflex_Socket'},'G19':{'RMRPistol_Socket', 'comp_socket', 'supressor_socket', 'light_socket', 'laser_socket', 'SROPistol_Socket', 'flash_socket', 'Reflex_Socket'}}Now we parse through the ItemDataTable and look for the corresponding attachment AvailableUnderbarrelAttachments(0). Once we do, we check the weapon_to_attachments dictionary, and add all the attachments to the weapon.for item in data[\"Exports\"][0][\"Table\"][\"Data\"]: for item_data in item[\"Value\"]:\t if item_data[\"Name\"] == \"AvailableUnderbarrelAttachments(0)\": name = item[\"Value\"][0][\"CultureInvariantString\"] try: comp_attachments = weapon_to_attachments[name] except: continue attachments_to_add = [] for under in all_under: if all_under[under] in comp_attachments: attachments_to_add.append(under) for attachment in attachments_to_add: copied = copy.deepcopy(attachment_dic_format) copied[\"Value\"] = attachment if copied not in item_data[\"Value\"]: item_data[\"Value\"].append(copied) continueFull code below.

An example can be found in Example Mod. If you are doing more than recoloring, you will also need to edit the normal and ORM maps. When ripping files from the game, look for files that contain T_, BaseColor, _B, as these files are usually the texture files. Modify the texture however you would like with GIMP, Photoshop, or any other image editing software. You can also use Substance Painter, and doing such will make texturing much easier. As with overriding any other object from the game, make sure to replicate the location of the texture. If you don’t, the changes won’t apply.

Import file into Blender using the Blender PSK plugin. Change the units into Metric, Meters, with a scale of 0.01. Scale the model and skeleton by 100. Unparent the skeleton from the model. Import the model you want to replace the normal model with, and resize it to fit properly. Delete the old model. And apply all transforms with Ctrl + A. Parent the skeleton to the new model using Ctrl + P. I recommend not automatically weight painting, and doing everything manually. Also make sure the root bone is the correct one. For guns this should be J_Gun. For other skeletal meshes, this will be something different. You can view the root bone in UModel. If you have another bone as the root, rename it to Armature, this makes Blender ignore that bone. Paint the weights accordingly. For guns you’ll most likely want to paint each moving piece with a value of 1.0. Export the file as an .fbx without leaf bones. Import the file into UE4. In order to make material files work, they must be instances of preexisting materials in the game. Instance a material, edit as you would like. Hook up your texture assets.

Ensure that the material name somewhat correlates to what you are modding. For example, an attachment should have the master material Weapon_1P_Toprain_MASTER. Alternatively, you can use UModel to export the material and look at the .txt file. In that file, while still using FModel, locate three parameters. These parameters will point to the Normal, Texture, and ORM maps. If you are using UModel instead, you can also view these parameters. In UE4, create a fake master material with the same name in the same location as where it is within the game. You will not be exporting this file unless you uncheck the Share Material Shader Code in Project Settings &gt; Packaging. In that master material, make sure to create three texture parameters named the same as the parameters you found using FModel or UModel. Make sure to hook up these nodes accordingly.
